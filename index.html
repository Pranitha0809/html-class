    <p>Some people argue that a paragraph should be measured by its ideas and not its sentence lengths, but a good general rule of thumb is to keep your paragraphs between 3 to 5 sentences long. This ensures that you are brief but still thorough in your writing.

Because there are technically no hard-and-fast rules to how long a paragraph should be, it is ultimately up to you, the writer. How many sentences are in one paragraph should depend on how well you convey information, and this number of sentences will vary from paragraph to paragraph.</p>
